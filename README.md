This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle HTML/JavaScript bug. The issue arises from an attempt to manipulate a DOM element that hasn't been defined in the HTML. This often leads to a silent failure or a JavaScript error in the console, making debugging tricky.  The solution focuses on robust error handling and proper DOM element verification before attempting any manipulation.
